<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></a></h2>


<p>The phenomenal success of "Cyrano de Bergerac" is undoubtedly
one of the most important literary events of the last
quarter of a century. It at once placed Edmond Rostand,
a young man of twenty-eight, at the head of the small
band of French dramatic writers, all men of marked ability,
Maurice Donnay, Georges de Porto-Riche, François de
Curel, Paul Hervieu, Henri Lavedan, etc., who had been
struggling for supremacy since the disappearance of the
two great masters of modern French comedy, Émile
Augier and Alexandre Dumas, fils. There was no hesitation
on the part of the public. It was at once recognised
that what had just been produced upon the stage was not
simply better than what had been seen for a long time, but
was also, to a certain extent, of a different nature. And
the verdict rendered by the French public in December,
1897, has since then been approved by readers and theatre-goers
in nearly every one of the countries belonging to
Western civilisation.</p>

<p>Can it be said, however, that to an American, or an Englishman,
"Cyrano" is all that it is to a Frenchman, that its
production would have been possible outside of as well as
in France, and its success as significant in London as in
Paris? If "Cyrano" is really a great work these questions
must be answered negatively, for it is in the nature of great
literary works that they consist of a combination of what
is purely human with what belongs to the time and place
where they have had their birth. They must have enough
of what is purely human to make it possible for them to be
universally accepted, understood and admired. But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
must be also strongly national, so that their universal acceptance
may help in spreading all over the world part of
the national ideal which prevails in their birthplace. And
to these elements may be joined a third one, which is sure
to add greatly to their success, and which "Cyrano" possesses
in a very high degree, viz: timeliness.</p>

<p>As soon as "Cyrano" appeared it seemed to the French
that this was just what they had been waiting for. Two
things especially appealed to them, one of a purely literary
nature, the other one a part of the basis of moral feelings
and ideas upon which the play is built.</p>

<p>First of all, it was a clear play, full of light and sunshine.
Edmond Rostand hails from the South of France, and the
atmosphere of his play is as translucid as the atmosphere
of his native Provence. It is as far removed from symbolism
and mysticism as the shores of the Mediterranean are
from the fogs of Scandinavia. Every incident in the play
rests upon some trait of character or combination of
circumstances which has been explained at some previous
moment. Every one of the leading characters, and
"Cyrano" most of all, stands out in bold relief, and there is
no mistaking what they stand for.</p>

<p>But this clearness is mainly for the countrymen of the
author. It depends partly upon the previous possession by
the audience of a number of notions which are part of the
intellectual inheritance of the race. The play, although
quite modern in its style and construction, is in some respects
for the French a resurrection of a portion of their
glorious past. For them the <i>Hôtel de Bourgogne, les Précieuses</i>,
Cardinal de Richelieu, etc., are more than mere
names. The earlier part of the Seventeenth Century was
for France a period of wonderful national energy. It is
then, and not later, that France acquired that supremacy
over the European Continent which is usually associated
with the name of Louis XIV, but which was already established
when that monarch assumed the reins of government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p>The timeliness of Rostand's great play was shown exactly
in this, that it called the attention of the French back to a
time when the nation was full of youthful and vigourous
ambition, when a Frenchman would hardly believe that
there was anything that he could not do if he set his mind
to it, when it became the fashion to say that "Impossible
was not a French word."</p>

<p>Ever since the war of 1870 the pall of defeat had hung
over the French. The stage showed this in a striking manner.
The plays that were produced presented on the whole
a stern or a pessimistic conception of life. The great periods
of history, especially, in which French valour carried everything
before it, remained neglected, for fear of the painful
contrast which they would present with the humiliated
condition of a vanquished country.</p>

<p>The men who wrote these plays belonged to a generation
in which, using the words of a French academician, "the
mainspring of joy had been broken."</p>

<p>But the young men who now come to the front, and who
have no more brilliant representative than Edmond Rostand,
belong to another generation. They have not known the
pangs of defeat; the mutilation of the beloved Fatherland
was an accomplished fact when they began to feel and to
think. They viewed French history not as concentrated
in its last and heart-rending episode, but as spreading
through centuries of heroic deeds, oftener illuminated by
the dazzling sunshine of victory than darkened by the
gloom of defeat. They were growing tired of hearing it repeated
on all tones that life was not worth living, and they
longed for some one who would shout in a voice loud
enough to be heard by the whole world, "Let the dead past
bury its dead."</p>

<p>In the acclaim that greeted "Cyrano de Bergerac" on December
28th, 1897, therefore, there was something more
than applause for a great dramatic work: there was gratitude
for the poet who had dispelled at last the atmosphere
of sadness which had come to be stifling for the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Frenchmen of our time. The period of deep mourning was
proclaimed to be over. Glances towards the past were
again declared to be indulged in only as inspirations for the
future. The glory, the joyfulness of action again appeared
as living realities, not as the deceptive dreams of unsuspecting
ignorance. Thus "Cyrano" presented to the
French a play such as they had not seen for a long time.
There had been plenty of problem plays, or <i>pieces à thése</i>,
as the French say; "Cyrano" was a <i>piece à panache</i>.</p>

<p>Seldom has, indeed, the purpose of a dramatist been more
clearly pointed out than in "Cyrano." When the hero of the
play breathes his last, after an imaginary fight with all the
unworthy traits of human nature and society which he had
antagonized during his checkered life, the one thing which
he informs his friends cannot be taken from him, which he
will proudly carry to the very presence of God, is his <i>panache</i>,
and this is the last word, and, as it were, the affabulation
of the drama.</p>

<p>Now, what is this <i>panache</i> upon which "Cyrano" sets such
a high value? To understand it is to appreciate, to miss it
is to miss the meaning of the play. An explanation of it is,
therefore, not out of place in this introduction.</p>

<p>The <i>panache</i> is an external quality which adds colour and
brilliancy to internal things already worth having for their
own intrinsic value. Its main justification is personal
bravery. To take an example, the generals of the French
Revolution, the marshals of Napoleon's army, all possessed
personal bravery to a high degree. They were not all distinguished
by the <i>panache</i>. Some of them, indeed, Marshal
Davout, for instance, were strikingly devoid of it. The
representative of the <i>panache</i> among them was essentially
Murat. The <i>panache</i> is literally a high plume, or bunch of
plumes, that waves high above a commander's head-gear.
Murat was bravery itself. But he had to be as conspicuous
as possible. He dressed as gorgeously as he could. He
rode a superb charger, and rode it superbly. His fur cap
was always surmounted by a high and richly coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
plume, which was always discerned just where the battle
most fiercely raged. Not his the deeply laid and skilfully
carried out plans, but the brilliant and heroic cavalry
charge. His eyes, his very voice, irrespective of what he
said, were an inspiration to his men, and dispelled all fear
of death. There is magnetism in the <i>panache</i>, and readers
may remember that a few years ago an American statesman
whom his friends proclaimed to be magnetic if nothing
else, was known throughout the land as the Plumed Knight.
"Rally round my white panache," Henry the Fourth said
to his soldiers; "you will find it always on the path of
honour and duty." The <i>panache</i>, too, is essentially joyful.
"Cyrano" is joyful, in spite of a life that would breed
discouragement and bitterness in almost any heart but his.
If reality denies him his share of happiness, then he will
find it in the domain the ideal. He will not have to go
without it.</p>

<p>And here we strike another cause of "Cyrano's" success.
It is not simply a play, it is a poem, and poetry always
leads us towards the ideal. This is undoubtedly one of the
reasons underlying the love of the French for a verse play.
The very swing of its verbal development lifts us above the
trivialities of daily life.</p>

<p>One might almost say that the verse play is as characteristic
of the French as the Wagnerian lyric drama is of the
Germans.</p>

<p>Corneille, Racine, Hugo, Molière himself in such a play as
<i>le Misanthrope</i>, are idealists, and their message to the
world at large, to which must now be added that of the
brilliant author of "Cyrano," tells of things better than
those we see around us, of things of beauty which it lies in
every one of us to bring somewhat nearer to our touch, if
we will only have the courage to live up to them.</p>

<p>A few words now about the new rendering of the play
which is here presented to the English-reading public. A
number of translations of "Cyrano" have appeared before
this one. If the facts were known, however, it would perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
appear that Mr. Charles Renauld's is the earliest of all.
It was undertaken by its author under the spell cast upon
the French mind by the sudden revelation of Rostand's
genius, the nature and causes of which it has been the purpose
of this production to elucidate.</p>

<p>The Shakespearian character of the play, displayed in
the freedom with which the author brings in everything
that seems to him likely to complete the portrait of his
hero, has been recognised by the translator, as is shown by
his use of a combination of prose and verse passages.</p>

<p>A real translator must be equally at home in the language
of the work translated and in the language into which he
translates it. He must be in thorough sympathy with the
mental attitudes of the two nations whose speeches he is
transmuting one into the other. He must be able to be a
component atom of that collective being, the public, on one
side as well as on the other of the national frontiers that
divide them. Thus only will he be able to discover the
means that will produce upon the reader of the translation
the impression first received by contact with the original.</p>

<p>The readers of Mr. Renauld's translation will, it is
thought, acknowledge that he possesses in a high degree
the above-described qualifications, and that he has been
peculiarly felicitous, when the text did not lend itself to
translation proper, in devising what may be termed adequate
equivalents.</p>

<p>Of the faithfulness of his rendering those acquainted
with the French language will easily judge, as they can
have under the same cover the English of the translator
and the French of the dramatist, and they will thus, it is
hoped, acquire a clear and adequate conception of the beautiful
picture, which, thanks to Edmond Rostand, has restored
life and brilliancy to the somewhat faded features of
that eccentric philosopher, poet, hero and gentleman,
Savinien Hercule de Cyrano Bergerac.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"><i>PREFACE.</i></a></h2>


<p>The author of this translation trusts that he is not presuming
too much if, despite his aversion for anything akin
to offensive thought and mention of self, he claims the
privilege of prefacing the result here presented of his labours
with a few remarks, not as a plea <i>pro domo sua</i>, but
as an explanation relating to the motives and to the methods
by which he was guided in his work.</p>

<p>First of all, he desires to state that this, his version of
Edmond Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac" was written in
the early part of 1898, and copyrighted in Washington long
before any other rendering in English of the beautiful and
now celebrated play was either published or performed.
Why did he withhold it until now? Simply because Mr.
Edmond Rostand, with whom he was not in touch, had
innocently, or under insufficient advice, neglected to copyright
in the United States, and had meanwhile made arrangements
for the performance of the play in America.
Was the writer, who has long been, and is still, battling for
a better protection of literary property, to interfere with,
or even seem in any way to invade these arrangements?
He thought not, despite solicitations to the contrary. True
that, armed with the valid copyright of his own work, and
with many technicalities at his disposal, he could have
brought about considerable litigation in his own behalf,
that would possibly have resulted in an indirect defence of
Mr. Rostand's moral rights still subsisting. But in the face
of a very doubtful issue in the courts, with a possible charge
of officiousness out of them, he thought it wiser to abstain,
allowing time meanwhile to accomplish its work of adjustment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>Others, however, apparently satisfied with safety for a
justification, have not treated with the same respect Mr.
Rostand's moral rights and the arrangements made by him
for the American production of his "Cyrano de Bergerac."
The play has been mutilated, adapted, or "improved" to suit.
There are just now, it is said, some twenty so-called stock
companies presenting it in different cities throughout the
United States. The original in French has been openly reprinted
here, likewise its British translation, and other
translations (so-called) have been offered to the public.
Mr. Rostand did not copyright. Hence the result of his labours,
of his genius, belongs, it would seem, to whoever
chooses to pick it up!</p>

<p>In these circumstances and now, there certainly can be
no impropriety in the publication of this work, the more so
as Mr. Rostand is to receive in this instance the royalties to
which he is morally entitled.</p>

<p>Further even. Who knows but that this royalty-paying
version in book form, or produced on the stage (the right to
perform it having been expressly reserved by the writer),
may not assist in setting aside the different versions that
now interfere with Mr. Rostand's moral rights, as well as
with the arrangements he chose to make for stage production
in America? Diffidence would prevent the translator,
were it not for the valuable encouragement he has received,
from adding that the present version of "Cyrano de Bergerac"
may, perchance, better than any of the renderings
in English now extant, lead to an adequate conception of
the beauties of the work in French.</p>

<p>At all events, those who were consulted, including the
eminent publishers, and the distinguished writer of the Introduction
to this book, freely agreed with the author in
his opinion that publication under the foregoing conditions
could do no harm, while it might effect considerable good,
were it only as an example in many respects, proving,
among other things, that there are those, even in America,
for whom impunity does not constitute right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>But enough "talk of shop," perhaps too much, for the
<i>genus irritabile vatum</i>.</p>

<p>At this point, the author feels that, if he expatiated on
his methods of translation, he might with some justice be
accused of tiresome insistence, or, to put it more gently, of
obduracy in esoterism. He will, therefore, confine himself
to a few statements, and make them as short as possible.</p>

<p>This version of "Cyrano de Bergerac" was written originally
for the stage, where, according to opinion behind as
well as before the curtain, in America at least, verse may
be acceptable for the expression of occasional flights of
thought, but not through the whole of a play, and especially
not for such portions of a play as are necessarily
colloquial. To explain this alleged distaste for verse on the
stage would lead us far beyond the limits of a preface. Suffice
it, then, to say, reserving developments for some future
occasion, that, for poetic emotion, English verse is more
than the French dependent on form, on expression. In
other words, English verse is less than the French free to
consider only thought, or substance, irrespective of words,
or construction. As a rule, then, it would seem in English
that dress comes first and figure next; while in French the
order appears to be reversed. In consequence (and setting
aside the fact that there exists a "magic of words," that
has been an all-time and frequent deceiver of men), the
average reader or listener instinctively expects from English
verse a somewhat conventional language, diversified
with unusual words and exceptional contractions, inversions,
etc. It follows that, when this special phraseology
and peculiar construction are applied to everyday thoughts,
facts, occurrences and sentiments, the effect produced is
not an agreeable one, by reason of a sort of clash, the appearance
of a thing of prose, straight-laced and overdressed
in verse, in a word, unnaturalness. Further, the majority
of English-speaking actors, unavoidably imbued with the
same spirit, so soon as they deal with verse, unconsciously
resort to a stilted diction that is distressingly far-removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
from the art that consists, through tedious and patient
work, in being natural.</p>

<p>Natural, unconstrained verse can, with proper care, it is
thought, be written in English, and can certainly, with appropriate
training, be delivered with naturalness. This
done, our audiences would no doubt take kindly to the
rhythm of plays in verse. But, as this does not yet seem to
have been fully accomplished, the undersigned translator
of "Cyrano de Bergerac" reluctantly decided to use both
verse and prose. For this liberty, though justified as above,
he feels that he owes the French poet an apology, adding,
however, that the deed brought its own punishment, since,
strange as it may appear to some, it would have been much
easier to render the play all in verse.</p>

<p>As to verse and metrics, on which, in this instance, a
book could (and later, may) be written, the author of this
translation must now rest satisfied with the following brief
remarks.</p>

<p>Enlightened by considerable experience, the result of
many experiments and after much thought, he adopted
blank pentameter as the true equivalent in English of
French riming Alexandrine verse. First, because in English,
frequent elisions making many syllables heavy, and
"run on" lines practically adding to the number of syllables,
the ten-syllable line of English verse is in reality the
counterpart of the twelve-syllable verse in French. And
second, because the object of rime being, not to repeat a
given sound, but to <i>beat time</i>, the strongly accentuated syllables
of English, as compared with the very much more
even enunciation of French, are quite sufficient, without
rime or assonance, to <i>mark rhythm</i>. Thus he avoided at
least one criticism, to wit: rime is monotonous!</p>

<p>Touching metrics, the writer will here go only one step
in the ways of heresy, by stating that, in his opinion, such
words as "our," "hour," "fire," etc., should be, as in
French, "duel," "hier," etc., counted for one syllable, or
for two syllables, according to rhythm as influenced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
the stronger or weaker emphasis called for by the <i>sense</i> of
the word. This could be elucidated by examples, the place
of which, however, is not here.</p>

<p>More generally as to methods, the writer makes free to
state that, exerting himself to avoid <i>literal</i> translation (too
often productive of laughable nonsense), and <i>free</i> translation
(frequently a substitution of the translator's for the author's
thoughts), he endeavoured, as in previous works of
the same nature, to give what he has termed an <i>equivalent</i>
translation. In other words, he strove to remain really
true to the original by creating in detail, as well as in a general
way, in English words on English minds the <i>impression</i>
caused by French words on French minds. Some examples
of the <i>equivalence</i> at least sought for will be found in
the foot-notes on several pages of this book.</p>

<p>As to "le panache" that surmounts this masterpiece,
"Cyrano de Bergerac," of which it is the main feature,
sending through it a breath of joyful daring "quand
même," the writer sought, as will be seen, to describe it in
triolets. These, too, might need to be explained, were it not
for the able commentary to be found in the Introduction so
kindly written for this book by one of the most learned and
esteemed professors of our Columbia University.</p>

<p>The writer trusts that he may be pardoned for going at
such length into some of the minutiæ of his task, and he
certainly should be acquitted if he thereby succeeded in
showing how much labour must be expended to produce
even a tolerable translation, and consequently, how little
justice is very often done to translators in general. He
commends these details to his friends as an inducement to
think a while before they leap, or rather jump at conclusions.
Were he less charitably disposed, or more eager
for a practical demonstration, he could say to them simply:
"Try the task!"</p>

<span class="smaller">A PERFORMANCE AT THE HOTEL DE BOURGOGNE THEATRE.</span></h2>


<p><i>The interior of the Hotel de Bourgogne Theatre, in 1640.
A sort of Racket-Court arranged and decorated in view of
performances. The auditorium is a long square. It runs
diagonally, and forms the background, one of its sides beginning
at first entrance, right, and ending at last entrance,
left, where it forms a right angle with the stage, that is
thus seen canted. On each side of this stage, benches along
the wings. The curtain is in two pieces of tapestry, that
can be drawn apart. Above the proscenium, the royal
arms. Wide steps lead from the stage to the auditorium.
On either side of these steps, seats for the violin-players.
Foot-lights composed of candles.</i></p>

<p><i>Two galleries, one above the other, running along the
side of the auditorium (that forms the diagonal background).
The upper gallery is divided into boxes. No
seats in the pit. In the rear of this pit, really front first
entrance right, a few benches in tiers. Under a staircase
leading to the galleries, and only the lower part of which
can be seen, a refreshment side-board bearing lights,
flowers, glasses, plates of cakes, decanters, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>In the rear, centre, under the galleries, the entrance to the
house. A wide door, half opened now and then to admit
the audience. Near this door, as well as near the side-board
and in other places, red posters giving the name of
the play about to be performed: "La Clorise."</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, the house is empty and rather dark.</i></p>

nose properly indicates a man that is affable, kind, courteous,
witty, liberal and brave, such as I am, and such as

<p>No, no, that's a little too short, young man! You might
have said.... Well.... many things.... in different
keys. For instance, listen: <i>Aggressive</i>: "I, Sir, had I such
a nose, would at once have it amputated."&mdash;<i>Friendly</i>: "It
must dip into your glass. To drink with comfort, you
should have a hanap constructed!"&mdash;<i>Descriptive</i>: "It is
a rock!... a peak!!.... a headland!!! More
than a headland, a whole peninsula!"&mdash;<i>Inquisitive</i>: "What
may this oblong thing be used for? A writing-desk or a
tool-chest?"&mdash;<i>Pleasant</i>: "Do you love birds so much that
you feel bound to offer them so comfortable a resting
place?"&mdash;<i>Fierce</i>: "When you use tobacco, Sir, can you emit
smoke from that nose without your neighbours' crying that
there is a chimney on fire?"&mdash;<i>Thoughtful</i>: "Be careful;
so much top-hamper might cause you to fall!"&mdash;<i>Affectionate</i>:
"Have a parasol made for it; the sun might fade its
colour!"&mdash;<i>Pedantic</i>: "For so much flesh on so much bone
beneath the forehead, we must go back, Sir, to the animal
Aristophanes calls Hippocampelephantocamelos!"&mdash;<i>Flippant</i>:
"Why! man, is that the fashion for hooks?
Certainly convenient for hanging up a hat!"&mdash;<i>Emphatic</i>:
"Masterly nose, no wind can make you catch aught but a
fractional cold! None but a northern hurricane!"&mdash;<i>Dramatic</i>:
"When it bleeds, we have the Red Sea!"&mdash;<i>Admiringly</i>:
"For a perfumer, what a sign!"&mdash;<i>Lyric</i>:
"Is it a shell trumpet, and are you a triton?"&mdash;<i>Innocent</i>:
"When is this monument open to visitors?"&mdash;<i>Respectful</i>:
"This is really owning a mansion with a gable on it!"&mdash;<i>Countrylike</i>:
"That be not a nose, but a big turnip, or a
young melon!"&mdash;<i>Military</i>: "Point against cavalry!"&mdash;<i>Practical</i>:
"Will you put it up in a lottery? It will
surely be the largest prize!"&mdash;Finally, to parody the grief

<p>That is about what you might have said, dear boy, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
had a sprinkling of letters and a bit of humour. Of humour,
though, lamentable being, you never had an atom; and, as
to letters, you never had but the four that spell the word
Fool!&mdash;Some invention is requisite for extravagant jests
before such an audience, but, even if you had it, you could
not have uttered a quarter of the half of the beginning of

<span style="margin-left: 7em;">A deadly danger, though</span><br />
She knows it not; a snare that Nature made<br />
Unconscious, like a sweetly budding rose<br />
Whose leaves conceal,&mdash;in ambush lurking, love.<br />
Who sees her smile knows what perfection is:<br />
Her slightest touch engenders loveliness;<br />
She moves as if all heaven's grace were hers,<br />
And Venus ne'er embarked in any shell,<br />
Nor did Diana tread the sylvan paths<br />
As my adored can step into a chair!

Why! Look at me, good friend, and say what hope<br />
There can be with .... such a protuberance!<br />
I clearly see the truth. But, then, of course,<br />
My heart will beat, perchance, at eventide,<br />
If, with this nose, I scent the breath of spring.<br />
Or else, I see, along some moonlit path,<br />
A whisp'ring pair of lovers slowly move;<br />
And then I think what rapture would be mine<br />
If on my arm a gentle creature leaned.<br />
I dream: but suddenly, I'm brought to sense.<br />
By what? Alas! My profile on the wall!

large establishment in Paris, on the corner of the Rue St.-Honoré
and the Rue de l'Arbre-Sec. In the rear, through
the wide glazed door, the streets are plainly seen, grey in the
light of dawn.</i></p>

<p><i>To the left, first entrance, a counter, above which is an iron
frame, from hooks on which are suspended geese, ducks and
white peacocks. Large crockery vases containing ordinary
plants, principally sunflowers. On the same side, second
entrance, a wide fireplace, before which, between two monumental
andirons, on each of which a pot is hung, several
roasts, the fat of which is dripping into pans.</i></p>

<p><i>To the right, first entrance, a door. Second entrance, a
staircase leading up to a small inside room, the interior of
which is visible through its open blinds; a table is there,
with cover set, lighted by a Flemish chandelier. A wooden
gallery at the top of the staircase leads seemingly to other
rooms of the same sort.</i></p>

<p><i>In the centre of the shop, an iron ring is hung: it can be
lowered by means of a pulley, and on it are large pieces of
game, meat, hams, etc. It forms a peculiar sort of chandelier.</i></p>

<p><i>Under the staircase, the glow of several ovens. Copper
saucepans shine. Spits are turning. Morning activity.
Cook-boys run in and out. Fat chefs are seen now and then.
Loads of cakes and meat-pies are brought in on willow trays.</i></p>

<p><i>Tables are garnished with cakes and eatables. Other
tables, with chairs around, are prepared for customers. A
small table in a corner is covered with papers. Before it is
seated Ragueneau, who is writing, as the curtain rises.</i></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span>, <span class="smcap-all">ROXANE</span>, <i>and, a moment</i>, <span class="smcap-all">THE DUENNA</span>.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>
Among all moments be the present blessed,<br />
Since, ceasing to forget that I exist,&mdash;<br />
However humbly&mdash;you have come to say....<br />
To say....
</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE</span> (<i>who has unmasked</i>).</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">To say: I thank you heartily.</span><br />
For, know you now, the fop, the brainless wretch<br />
You vanquished yesterday in noble strife,<br />
Was being forced upon me....</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">(<i>bashfully</i>)</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">....As a mate</span><br />
For life, by one who says he loves me....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 15em;">Guiche!....</span><br />
Who's good at scheming thus....</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 13em;">(<i>saluting</i>)</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 13em;">So then I fought,</span><br />
Not for my nose, but for your smiling eyes.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>And then I wished.... but the admission needs<br />
That I should find in you.... the brother that<br />
You were of yore....when we were children both.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>When Bergerac was our summer ground....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>And reeds made up your goodly stock of swords....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>While waving corn gave flowing hair for dolls.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>What happy days! For you my will was law....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>You're now Roxane; you then were Madeleine.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>And pretty?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">You were not a sorry sight.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>How often, romping, you would get a hurt!<br />
Then, motherly, I'd say, in sternest voice:<br />
"Another frolic and another scratch!"....</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>She stops astonished.</i>)</p>

<p>The same to-day! What's this?</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Cyrano tries to withdraw his hand.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">No, let me see!</span><br />
You're still a boy, it seems.&mdash;Say when and how!<br />
</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>At play just now, around the Porte de Nesle.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE</span> (<i>taking a seat at one of the tables, and

<p>Your hand!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>taking a seat near her</i>).</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">How gently thoughtful you've remained!</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>How many foes?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Not quite a hundred.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">Oh!</span><br />
Do tell me all!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 7em;">What for? It's better far</span><br />
You tell me what you did not dare to say....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>But now I dare. The memories of yore<br />
Assist me. I'm....in love with somebody.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Who knows it not....</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">Indeed!</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 18.5em;">.... Not yet.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">But he shall know it soon.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">Indeed!</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Poor fellow, he has loved me timidly,<br />
And from afar, and never dared to speak!<br />
</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Your hand is feverish.... Oh! I easily could see the

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Indeed!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE</span> (<i>as she finished bandaging his hand</i>).</p>

<p>And see what a coincidence, dear cousin! He belongs to
your regiment!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Indeed!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p>Why, of course, he is a cadet in your Company!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>He bears on his brow the mark of intelligence, of genius!<br />
He is haughty, noble, young, intrepid, handsome,....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>rising, very pale</i>).</p>

<p>Handsome!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Why! what is the matter?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>The matter? Nothing .... It is .... It is ....</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Showing his hand and smiling</i>). This little scratch.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Oh! Well, I really love him. I must say, however, that
I have seen him only at the Theatre ....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Then you have not spoken to each other?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Our eyes alone have done the talking.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Well, then, how do you know?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Beneath the linden trees of the Place Royal there is some
gossipping .... and information has reached me ....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>He is a cadet, you say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Yes, a cadet in the Guards.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>His name?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Baron Christian de Neuvillette.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>How?.... There is nobody of that name among the
cadets.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Oh! yes, there is, since this morning. His Captain is
Carbon of Haughty-Hall.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>And so, quick, quick, we throw away our little heart?....
But my poor child....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">THE DUENNA</span> (<i>looking in at the door</i>).</p>

<p>Monsieur de Bergerac, I have finished the cakes!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Well, then, read the verses that you will find on the
bags!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Duenna disappears.</i>)</p>

<p>.... My poor child, for you who are accustomed to refined
language, to subtle thoughts,&mdash;suppose he were
thoroughly uninitiated, in fact, a savage!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Oh! no, he has the hair of a hero!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Suppose he were as poor in speech as rich in hair.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>No, all his words are choice; I can tell by seeing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Of course, all words are choice when they come through
a mustache that is well curled.&mdash;But suppose he were a
dunce!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE</span> (<i>striking the floor with her foot, impatiently</i>).</p>

<p>Well, it would kill me! There!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>after a pause</i>).</p>

<p>And it is to tell me this that you asked me to meet you
here? I fail to see the necessity of the appointment,
Madam.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>The fact is that somebody frightened me yesterday by
telling me that you are all Gascons in your Company....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>And that we challenge any beardless hero who, through
influence, and not being really a Gascon, manages to get
assigned to our Gascon Company? That is what you were
told.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>And you imagine how I tremble for him?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>between his teeth</i>).</p>

<p>Not without good reason!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>But then I was reminded of you, and of your skill and
courage, your great achievements; and I thought: if he,
Cyrano, whom everyone respects, would....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>'Tis well. I'll answer for your little baron.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Yes, defend him always, please. And many thanks!
You know how fond of you I've always been?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Oh! yes, I know.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>You'll be his friend?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>I will.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>And he shall have no duels to fight.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>None; you have my promise.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>What a good fortune!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">LE BRET</span> (<i>whispering to Cyrano</i>).</p>

<p>Impossible, Sir! My blood curdles at the thought of my

How comical the spots on doublets made<br />
By envy's gall and cowardice's slaver!<br />
&mdash;Loose friendships like to those you cultivate<br />
Resemble the Italian collars, soft<br />
And open-worked, that feminize your necks.<br />
They're easy and of tranquil-going mien;<br />
Your head with them can bend to any will.<br />
Not so with me! For Hatred, every morn,<br />
Makes stiff the ruff that forces up my head!<br />
An enemy I gain's another fold<br />
That straightens me the more, perhaps, but adds<br />
A beam to my renown. The Spanish ruff,<br />
Though sitting on the neck as would a yoke,<br />
With some can be a halo 'round the head!

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Stupid? You are not, friend, since you realise your inability.

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>looking at Christian</i>).</p>

<p>Oh! that for the feelings of my soul I had such an interpreter!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN</span> (<i>despairing</i>).</p>

<p>What would I not give for eloquence!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).</p>

<p>I'll lend you some! Lend you to me your physical attraction,
and the two combined will constitute the hero of

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN.</span></p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN.</span></p>

<p>What is it you propose?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>In Roxane's eyes you shall not be disgraced. Together,
if you will, we can gain her love. Will you allow the soul
so ill-restrained by my buckskin here to breathe and sing
beneath your embroidered doublet?....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN.</span></p>

<p>But Cyrano....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>.... Christian, will you?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN.</span></p>

<p>Would it give you so much pleasure?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>enraptured</i>).</p>

<p>It would....</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>returning to his senses, and lightly</i>)</p>

We poets have about us, as a rule,<br />

Take this and make a truth of what is feigned.<br />
My rambling words of rapture flutter like<br />
Bewildered birds; you'll cause them to alight.<br />
The letter shows, itself&mdash;now take it!&mdash;that<br />
My eloquence was born of artifice.

<p><i>A small public square in the old Marais quarter of Paris.
Old houses, narrow streets. To the right Roxane's house
and garden, over the wall of which spread and hang the
branches of large trees inside. Above the door, a window
and a balcony. By the door a stone bench.</i></p>

<p><i>Ivy creeps up the wall, and a jasmine twines around the
balcony. By means of the bench and of stones projecting
from the wall, it is comparatively easy to climb up to the
balcony.</i></p>

<p><i>Over the way, an old house in the same style, brick and
stone, with a door, the knocker of which is wrapped with
rags like a sore finger.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, the Duenna is seated on the bench.
The window on Roxane's balcony is wide open. Standing
near the Duenna is Ragueneau, wearing a sort of livery.
He is concluding a story, and wiping his eyes.</i></p>

<p>Oh! they are part of a bet I won. D'Assoucy and I had a
discussion on a point of grammar. No! Yes! No! Yes! Of
a sudden he points to these two scarecrows here, his constant
escort, great in the art of scratching a string with a
claw, and he says: "I'll bet you a whole day of music!"&mdash;He
lost. And now, until to-morrow comes, I must enjoy
both the strains and the presence of these two harmonious
witnesses of all my acts!.... Pleasant, if you like, in the
beginning, but now the pleasure is growing less.</p>

<p>To ask Roxane if the friend of her soul is still as faultless

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE</span> (<i>coming out of the house</i>).</p>

<p>How beautiful, how clever he is! and how I love him!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p>Indeed! And is Christian so very clever?....</p>

<p>Yes, dear friend, more so even than yourself!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>So be it, then!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>To my mind, it would be impossible for anyone to deliver
with more elegance and wit than he does these pretty
trifles that are nothing, if you will&mdash;and still are everything.
At times, it is true, he seems quite absent-minded; but,
suddenly, he recovers and says the most charming
things!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>incredulous</i>).</p>

<p>You surprise me!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>You men are really astonishing! Because Christian is
handsome, he <i>must</i> be stupid!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>I doubt if he can speak of hearts and love.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Still better. Just listen.</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>reciting</i>).</p>

<p>"The more you take of what's my heart, the more I've

<p>So! So!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>At first he had too much heart; now he has not enough.
It would be interesting to know exactly how much heart
would satisfy him.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>You are exasperating! True jealousy!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>I meet him everywhere.... with one of those cadets....
this Neu.... vil.... Neuvil....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>A tall man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>A blond.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Red-haired, rather.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Handsome!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>For some, perhaps, but....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>But very stupid.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>So it struck me! (<i>changing her manner</i>).</p>

<p>....Your revenge as regards Cyrano no doubt consists
in holding him under fire, which he relishes. So I hardly
see great vengeance for you in that. I can tell you, though,
what would wound him to the quick!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>And that is?....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>To have his regiment and his dear cadets remain, so long
as there is war, right here, in Paris, inactive! The only
way to punish him is to deprive him of danger.</p>

<p>Woman! Woman! No one but a woman would think of
such a scheme!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>getting closer to Roxane</i>).</p>

<p>You have then some regard for me? (<i>She smiles.</i>) The

<p>I have the orders here for every company, and they shall
be sent immediately, except....</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>he takes one out of the batch</i>) this one! It is
for the cadets, and (<i>puts it into a pocket</i>)</p>

<p>I hold it back! Ha! ha! Cyrano....so eager for the
fray! And so you play with people as with mice, Roxane?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Sometimes!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>quite close to her</i>).</p>

<p>You enthrall me! Roxane, listen. To-night&mdash;yes, I
know, I must depart. But leave you when I feel that you
are moved!....I cannot. Hear me! Close by here is the
convent of the Capuchin fathers. Laymen cannot enter it;
but, as the fathers serve my uncle Richelieu, they have some
regard for his nephew, and they will give me a place of concealment.
Officially, I shall have left for the front, but I
shall return to you under the cover of a mask. Allow me to
delay my departure a few hours, dear waywardness!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>But if you are discovered! Your reputation....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Zounds, Sir!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>I have just arrived&mdash;pardon me&mdash;by the last cyclone, and

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>No! I dropped from heaven! (<i>crossing his arms</i>). Would
you believe it? I noticed it as I was going by there:
Sirius, at night actually wears a turban! (<i>confidentially</i>)
The other Bear, the little one, is still too small to bite!
(<i>laughing</i>) As I was passing through the Lyre, I broke
one of its strings! (<i>proudly</i>) But I intend to write a book
on the subject; and the golden stars that I gathered into my
scorched cloak, regardless of peril, shall be used by my
printer for asterisks!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>No! No! I desire....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>To learn how I got up there? Easily. Through an invention
of mine.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>discouraged</i>).</p>

<p>A madman, certainly!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>disdainfully</i>).</p>

<p>I copied not the stupid eagle of Regiomontanus, or the
timid pigeon of Archytas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>A madman&mdash;but a learned one.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>No, Sir. I imitated nothing ever done.</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Guiche, having managed to pass, is nearing
Roxane's door, but Cyrano follows, ready to seize him.</i>)</p>

<p>I invented six different ways of assaulting the virgin

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>turning</i>).</p>

<p>Six?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>with increased fluency</i>).</p>

<p>I could, with body as bare as a taper, have comparisoned
it with crystal phials o'erflowing with tears from the morning
skies, and my person, then, if exposed in the sun, would
have been aspirated by the luminary along with the dew!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>astonished, goes toward Cyrano</i>).</p>

<p>True! That is one way!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>backing, so as to draw him further
away</i>).</p>

<p>Again, I could have created a powerful gust of wind, to
lift me, if I had rarefied the air in a cedar box, by means of
heated mirrors forming an icosahedron!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>following Cyrano</i>).</p>

<p>Two ways!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>still backing</i>).</p>

<p>Or else, being both a machinist and an artificer, have
straddled a steel-legged grasshopper, and caused myself,
through successive explosions of saltpetre, to be projected
into the azure fields where the stars are wont to graze!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>still following him, and counting on
his fingers</i>).</p>

<p>That is three!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Since smoke persists in rising, I might have blown into a
globe enough of it to carry me up!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>more and more astonished</i>).</p>

<p>Four!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Since Ph&oelig;be, when her bow is the thinnest, loves to draw,
O beeves! your marrow,.... anoint myself with the same!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>stupefied</i>).</p>

<p>Five!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>who has managed, while talking, to
press Guiche over to the other side of the
square, near a bench</i>).</p>

<p>Last: I could have placed myself upon an iron plate,
taken a magnet and thrown it up into the air! This is a
capital way. As soon as the magnet starts, the iron rushes
in pursuit of it. The magnet is thrown up again; the iron
plate follows&mdash;and, Cadedis! there is nothing to prevent
the ascension from lasting indefinitely.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Six!&mdash;All excellent systems. And, tell me, Sir, which
one of the six did you adopt?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>A seventh one!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>No!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>The tide!.... As it was running out, in obedience to
the attraction of the moon, I lay on the sands&mdash;head foremost,
so that my hair&mdash;hair, you know, does not dry fast&mdash;so
that my hair was kept bathed in the receding waves.
And, thus I was, by the moon's attraction, drawn up, up,
erect, like an angel. And up I went, gently, without an
effort, until suddenly, I felt a shock!.... Then!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>interested, takes a seat on the bench</i>).</p>

<p>Then?....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>to Carbon</i>).</p>

<p>Ha! Good morning!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Aside, after looking at Carbon, with satisfaction</i>).
His face is green!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CARBON</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p>There is nothing left of him but his eyes.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>looking at the Cadets</i>).</p>

<p>So, here are these soreheads!.... Yes, gentlemen, I
understand that I am jeered at plentifully here; that cadets,
nobility and gentry, barons all, are not over-burdened
with respect for their Colonel; that they charge me with
intrigue and court-flattery, that my lace collar over my
breastplate is an eye-sore to them,&mdash;and that it is distressing
to them to find that one can be a Gascon and still
not out at the elbow!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Silence. The Cadets continue to play and
smoke.</i>)</p>

<p>Shall I have you punished by your Captain? No.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CARBON.</span></p>

<p>Well, I am free and I punish only....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Ah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CARBON.</span></p>

<p>I paid for my company, and it belongs to me. I obey
only to war commands.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Ah!.... Well, that is sufficient.</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>speaking to the Cadets</i>).</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:11em">I can afford to scorn
your bluster. Everybody knows how I behave under fire.
Even yesterday, there were enough witnesses to the spirit
with which I routed Count de Bucquoi; leading my people
against his men like an avalanche, I charged him three
successive times!</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>without lifting his eyes from his book</i>).</p>

<p>How about your white scarf?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>surprised and satisfied</i>).</p>

<p>You know of this trifle?.... True, it happened, while
I was circling to gather my people for the third charge,
that a party of runaways forced me too close to the enemy;
I was in danger of being taken or shot, when, happily, I
bethought me to untie and to drop the scarf that told
my rank. In this way, and without attracting notice, I
managed to get away from the Spaniards, and to turn back
upon them with all my men, beating them terribly!&mdash;Now,
what do you say to this?</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>The Cadets affect not to listen, but they have
stopped playing, and they hold back the smoke of their pipes.
A wait.</i>)</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>I say that Henry IV, even surrounded by a host of foes,
never would have consented to diminish himself by casting
off his plume of snowy white.</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Silent joy. Playing and smoking are resumed.</i>)</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>The device was successful, however!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Playing and smoking again suspended.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Possibly! But who would abdicate the honour of being a
target?</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Playing and smoking resumed. Growing satisfaction.</i>)</p>

<p>Had I been present when the scarf slipped off,&mdash;see how
ideas of bravery can vary, Sir,&mdash;I should have picked it up
and put it on.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Gascon boasting again!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Boasting?.... Lend it to me. I offer to hang it on my
shoulder and, this very night, to scale with it the enemy's
fortifications.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>A Gascon's offer! You know full well that the scarf remained
on the enemy's ground, near the river Scarpe, a
place so well covered by Spanish guns that nobody can venture
there to get it!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>taking a white scarf from his pocket
and handing it to Guiche</i>).</p>

<p>Here it is!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Silence. The Cadets restrain their laughter
and affect to be very busy playing. Guiche turns and looks
at them; they assume an air of great gravity; one of them,
in an absent-minded way, half whistles one of the airs the

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>taking the scarf</i>).</p>

<p>Thank you! I can use this white fabric to make a signal,&mdash;that
I hesitated to give.</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>He goes to the embankment and waves the scarf
several times.</i>)</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ALL.</span></p>

<p>What is this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">THE SENTINEL</span> (<i>on the embankment</i>).</p>

<p>A man, over there, who is running away!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>coming down from the embankment</i>).</p>

<p>One who plays the part of a Spanish spy. He is very
useful to us; takes over to the enemy information that I
give him, so that we can influence their decision.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>He is a blackguard!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>slowly tying on his scarf</i>).</p>

<p>Yes, but a great convenience. What were we saying?....
Ah!.... I was going to apprise you of something.
Last night, in a desperate attempt to revictual us, the
Marshal left for Dourlens; he took with him so many men
that an attack upon us just now would certainly be successful.
Half of the army is away from the camp!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CARBON.</span></p>

<p>But the Spanish do not know of it.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Yes, they do. They are going to attack us. My false spy
came to tell me of it. He added: "I can have the attack
made wherever you prefer." I answered: "Good. Leave
the camp and watch it. The point to attack will be the one
from which I make a signal to you."</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CARBON</span> (<i>to the Cadets</i>).</p>

<p>Gentlemen, make ready!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>The Cadets rise and busy themselves preparing
for the fight.</i>)</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>The attack will take place in an hour from now.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">A FEW CADETS.</span></p>

<p>Oh!.... that is different!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>They sit down and resume playing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE</span> (<i>to Carbon</i>).</p>

<p>You must gain time, pending the Marshal's return.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CARBON.</span></p>

<p>And, in order to gain time, what shall we do?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>You will have the goodness to get killed, all of you, in defense
of the camp.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Ah! this is his vengeance!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>I will not pretend that, if I loved you, I should have
selected you; but, as your bravery has no equal, by using
you I am serving my king as well as my ill-will.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Allow me, Sir, to be thankful for the honour.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>Oh! I know that you love to fight one against a hundred.
You certainly cannot complain, then, that I leave you inactive.</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>He goes toward the rear with Carbon.</i>)</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>to the Cadets</i>).</p>

<p>Well, then we will add to the Gascon coat of arms, proud
of its six chevrons of azure and gold, gentlemen, another
chevron, still lacking, one of blood!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>Guiche speaks, aside, with Carbon in the rear.

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>placing his hand on Christian's

<p>Christian!</p>

<p>Roxane.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Alas!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN.</span></p>

<p>At least, I should like to condense all the loving farewells
of my heart into a beautiful letter!....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>I thought it might be for to-day, and....</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>He draws a letter from his doublet</i>)</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">.... I have written your farewell.</span></p>

<p>Yes, certainly!</p>

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>He opens the letter, reads, and stops.</i>)</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO</span> (<i>taking the letter and looking at it with

<p>A little round spot?....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN.</span></p>

<p>Yes, a tear!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Oh!.... Yes!.... we poets are caught in our own

this letter,&mdash;was heart-rending; I drew tears from my own

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Yes.... because.... to die is not so terrible .... but
....never to see her again, that is the torture! for the fact

<p>Do you know that they fired on my coach? It looks like
a squash, does it not? As in the fairy tale; and the lackeys

<p class="blockquot-sd">(<i>sending a kiss to Christian</i>).</p>

<p>How are you, dear?</p>

<p>Roxane, tell me how?....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>How I managed to find the army? Oh! my dear friend, it
was the simplest thing in the world: I drove on so long as I
saw the country laid waste. Such horrors must be seen to
be believed! If that is the service of your King, gentlemen,
my service is a better one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CYRANO.</span></p>

<p>Come, this is foolhardiness! How could you pass?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>How? Why! Right through the Spanish army.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">FIRST CADET.</span></p>

<p>Oh! women. They are knowing ones!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">GUICHE.</span></p>

<p>But how could you get through their lines?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">LE BRET.</span></p>

<p>It must have been very difficult!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Why! No. I just went along, in my coach, on a trot.
Whenever one of the Dons showed his haughty face, I put
on and displayed through the window my most fascinating
smile, and these gentlemen being, whatever the French may
say, the most courteous people in the world, I passed!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CARBON.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you have a most excellent passport in that smile!
But you must frequently have been called upon, Madam, to
declare whither you were going.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>Oh! yes, quite frequently. I answered simply: "I am
going to see my lover."&mdash;Immediately the most ferocious
Spaniard would gravely close the door of my coach, with a
knightly wave of the hand order up the muskets already
pointed at me, and, with as much grace as haughtiness, the
plume of his hat proudly floating on the breeze, bow low
and say: "Pass on, Senorita!"</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">CHRISTIAN.</span></p>

<p>But, Roxane....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

<p>I said: My lover. Yes, husband, you must forgive! You
will surely understand that, if I had said my husband, nobody
would have let me pass!</p>

Your letters, yes! My ardent love for you,<br />
Love passionate, was born that night of bliss<br />
When, from beneath my willing balcony,<br />
In accents that to both of us were new,<br />
A soul revealed itself to me....'twas yours....<br />
So that, each time your letters came, it seemed<br />
As if I lived those minutes once again,<br />
And, rapture-bound, I heard your voice itself,<br />
Those tender tones that twined around me then.<br />
So here am I! Penelope would not<br />
Have persevered in waiting labour if<br />
Ulysses could have written grandly so;<br />
But, daft as Helen, she, to join him, would<br />
Have flung away her tedious worsted balls.

<p><i>Fifteen years later, in 1655. The garden of the Convent
of the Ladies of the Cross, in Paris.</i></p>

<p><i>Beautiful shade trees. To the left, the house. Wide
porch on which several doors open. In the centre of the
stage, an enormous overspreading tree standing alone in a
sort of open circle. To the right, first entrance, backed by
high box-wood bushes, a semi-circular stone bench.</i></p>

<p><i>In the rear an avenue of chestnut trees leading up to
fourth entrance, right, where the door of the Chapel can be
seen through the branches. Beyond the avenue, lawns,
other rows of trees, shrubbery and the sky.</i></p>

<p><i>The Chapel has a small side door, from which starts, running
down to the right, first entrance, behind the box-wood
bushes, a sort of colonnade entwined with creepers rich in
hues of gold and red.</i></p>

<p><i>It is Autumn. The russet leaves of the trees are in bright
contrast with the green lawns, except the box-wood and yew-trees
that form dark spots here and there. Yellow leaves
beneath the trees; fallen leaves everywhere on the ground,
on the porch and on the benches.</i></p>

<p><i>Between the stone bench to the right and the tree in the
centre, a tapestry frame, and in front of it a chair. Baskets
full of worsted skeins and balls. On the frame, a
piece of tapestry-work, unfinished.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, sisters are going and coming
through the garden; some are seated on the bench, on either
side of an elderly sister. Leaves are falling.</i></p>

<p>That was very wrong!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER CLAIRE.</span></p>

<p>But Sister Martha pulled a plum out of the pie this morning;
I saw her do it.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">MOTHER MARGARET</span> (<i>to Sister Martha</i>).</p>

<p>Very wrong, indeed, Sister Martha!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER CLAIRE.</span></p>

<p>A little bit of a look!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER MARTHA.</span></p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">MOTHER MARGARET.</span></p>

<p>And more. Ever since his cousin, fourteen years ago,
saddened the whiteness of our caps with the darkness of
her widow's veil, as would a bird of sombre hue alighting
'mid a flight of brighter birds.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER MARTHA.</span></p>

<p>And he alone can relieve with a ray of light the grief that
she persists in feeding.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">THE OTHER SISTERS.</span></p>

<p>He is so entertaining!&mdash;It is fun when he comes!&mdash;He
teases us!&mdash;He is so kind!&mdash;We love him so!&mdash;And we make
sweets for him!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER MARTHA.</span></p>

<p>But he is not a very good Catholic!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER CLAIRE.</span></p>

<p>We'll convert him!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">THE OTHER SISTERS.</span></p>

<p>Assuredly, we will!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">MOTHER MARGARET.</span></p>

<p>I forbid your tormenting him on that score, children.
He might come here less often?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER MARTHA.</span></p>

<p>But.... dear Mother.... God....</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">MOTHER MARGARET.</span></p>

<p>Have no fear.... God knows him!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">SISTER MARTHA.</span></p>

<p>But, every Saturday, as he enters, he says proudly:
"Sister, like a bad Catholic, I ate meat yesterday!"</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">MOTHER MARGARET.</span></p>

<p>Is that what he says? Well, the last time he came he
had eaten nothing whatever for two days.</p>

<p>Yes, often. He is a very dear old friend, and he brings
me all the news. He comes regularly, every Saturday.
As the hour strikes, while I am at work on my tapestry, I
know, without even turning around to see, that he is here,
for I can hear his stick on the stone steps. If the weather
is fine, he sits under this tree, where his chair awaits him.
He laughs at what he calls my eternal work, relates to me
the events of the week, and....</p>

<p>Le Bret exaggerates!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">LE BRET.</span></p>

<p>All as I predicted: desertion and poverty!.... His

nobility, mock piety, mock bravery, plagiarism,&mdash;in fact
everybody!</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">ROXANE.</span></p>

They'll never reach him.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">DUKE</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>).</p>

<p>Who knows?</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">LE BRET.</span></p>

<p>What I fear for him is not an assault; it is solitude,
hunger, winter stealthily entering his poor abode. These
are the enemies that may lay him low.&mdash;Each morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
he buckles his belt a little tighter. His nose has now the
sallowness of old ivory. His wardrobe is reduced to one
suit of black.</p>

<p class="center-c"><span class="smcap-all">DUKE.</span></p>

<p>Ah! he at least is not a parvenu. So, do not pity him too
much. He has lived free from obligations and humiliating
restraint.</p>

I envy him at times. You see, Roxane,<br />
When we have had too much success in life,<br />

We feel within a thousand sickly stings<br />

To constitute remorse, but large enough<br />
To keep us in a dull uneasiness.<br />
Thus ducal mantles sweep, as we ascend<br />
The steps of greatness, with their fringe of furs<br />
A rustling heap of withered sentiments,<br />
As now your sombre train, upon the porch,<br />
Draws in its folds a bunch of autumn leaves.

the name of Cyrano's captain) see <a href="#Footnote_18_18">note</a> page <a href="#Page_77">77</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Note. "La dentelle des canons."&mdash;"Canons" were ornamental lace, embroidery
or ribbons around the lower edge of knee-breeches.&mdash;Not, as one translation
has it: "the canonical gentlemen's lace."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Query.&mdash;Might it not be argued that the "précieuses" were perhaps spiritual
daughters of the <i>euphuists</i>, disciples of John Lyly, who flourished in England under
Queen Elizabeth, about half a century before the time of action here?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Note.&mdash;Not "an insolent cocktail," as one translation has it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Note.&mdash;Literal translation of "nasigère," a word invented by Ragueneau,
would be euphuist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Note.&mdash;The play on the word "fraise" (both "strawberry" and "ruff")
could not be reproduced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Note.&mdash;Alexandrine verse adopted here and further on (beginning of <a href="#ACT_II">Act
II</a>) as being more pompous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Note.&mdash;The words "you kick," in the place of "tu récalcitres," were suggested
by a friend, as a better translation. But the good critic failed to realise
that Cyrano does not use slang, and is almost always, on the contrary, somewhat
hyperbolic, addicted to willful oddity of speech.&mdash;"Récalcitrant," adj.-part.
(doggedly resisting), is frequently used in French. But the infinitive
"récalcitrer," though it exists, and the other forms of the verb are seldom, if
ever, heard.&mdash;Cyrano, therefore, calls up a smile, if not a laugh, by resorting to
the verb in the second person, singular, present, indicative.&mdash;<i>To recalcitrate</i>
is a good English word (see Longfellow), but it is so seldom used that it creates
on the English ear the same impression of amused surprise that is induced by
the original.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Note.&mdash;One of the translations that have appeared in the New York daily
press renders "Céladon" by reference to Lord Chesterfield! The time of action
(first four acts) of "Cyrano de Bergerac" is 1640, and Lord Chesterfield was <i>born</i>
only 54 years <i>later</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Note.&mdash;In the original, Cyrano calls his opponent "Laridon." This is the
name of a degenerate <i>dog</i>. See fables of La Fontaine ("L'Education").</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Note.&mdash;"L'Envoi," as often written, supposedly in French, is incorrect.
It is, in French, when heading the last four lines of a ballade, "Envoi," without
the article, l' (le).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Note.&mdash;Alexandrines were adopted, instead of pentameter, here and further
on, with the poets, for the reason that they seem more pompous and better in
keeping with the affectation shown by the personages.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Note.&mdash;The spelling <i>rime</i> seems preferable to <i>rhyme</i>, since rime and rhythm
are two very distinct things.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Note.&mdash;The miserable pun on "puits" (well) was found possible to reproduce.
Needless to add that this is ambitious confectioner's verse, intentionally
nonsensical.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Note.&mdash;<i>Ridicuckoldulous</i> would be an exact translation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Note.&mdash;The Duenna, like Roxane, is a "précieuse," an euphuist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Note.&mdash;This is a Gascon oath. Like the similar oaths following, it would if
translated literally (Blood of God,) lose its picturesque and really innocent
character. All of these are oath-sounds rather than oaths, and somewhat oath-evading,
after the fashion of "goldarn it," in America.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Note.&mdash;The name "Castel-Jaloux," in the original, being indicative of Gascon
pride and superlativeness, it was thought better to translate it in order to preserve
colour. But here arose the question: "Him" or "He" of Haughty-Hall?
Both cases have their champions, with most excellent reasons. It was thought,
however, that argument might be avoided and the line be made more effective
by the insertion of a dash after "Carbon," thus leaving time for the imaginary
interrogation: "What Carbon?" following which suspension, the answer is.
"He of Haughty-Hall" is the Carbon meant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Note.&mdash;The text here, justified by a current French expression, would be too
broad in English.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Note.&mdash;In this tirade, and in the following one, <i>you</i>, <i>thou</i> and <i>she</i> are intentionally
interwoven. When Cyrano is carried by his emotion, he passes from
<i>you</i> to <i>thou</i>, which latter is, in French, familiar and endearing much more than
in English. Then, reclaimed by reason and fearing that he has overstepped the
bounds, he returns to the (in French) more formal <i>you</i>, or resorts to a discreet
<i>she</i>, only to forget himself again and to resume the caressing <i>thou</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Note.&mdash;"Un point rose qu'on met sur l'i du verbe aimer."
</p>
<p>
"A ruby O"...., as above, may prove, it is thought, a good example of
<i>equivalence</i>, the <i>i</i>, impossible here in English, finding in O a good substitute,
calling up, if not exactly the very same image, at least a kindred one fully as
good.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Note.&mdash;<i>Cucurbit</i> ("cucurbite") for moon is, in French, as odd as it appears
in English. The oddity of the expression, that assimulates Luna to the rotund
melon, pumpkin, etc., of the genus of plants known as <i>cucurbita</i>, is in keeping
with Cyrano's intentional extravagance of speech.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Note.&mdash;"Tu croques le marmot" (literally "you are eating the baby") is an
allusion to ogres' proverbial taste for infants, coupled with the somewhat slangy
meaning: "you are waiting long and impatiently." This in English would be
meaningless, and was perforce replaced by what seems to be a fair equivalent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Note.&mdash;A French proverb.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Note.&mdash;Intentional affectation, like that of "his indisposition was sentenced,
for high treason."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Note.&mdash;An evident anachronism, since Molière did not open his Paris theatre
until three years later (1658). Given, however, the deep knowledge of seventeenth
century matters displayed throughout this drama, the anachronism must
be intentional, the poet's object doubtless having been to embody the tradition
according to which the "Qu'allait-il faire dans cette galère?" of Molière's
"Fourberies de Scapin" (produced only in 1671) was taken from Cyrano de
Bergerac's "Le Pédant Joué."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Note.&mdash;"It" here is Death (feminine in French). The personifying <i>he</i>
somewhat customary in English poetry, was set aside, and the <i>neuter</i> gender
was intentionally preserved, because, being more vague, it better represents the
terror-striking <i>unknown</i>, and is more expressive of Cyrano's daring <i>contempt</i>
and repulsion for a loathsome <i>thing</i>. Cyrano, who put to flight one hundred
men, could not be expected to fear a person, much less a personification.</p></div>
